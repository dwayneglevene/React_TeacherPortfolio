            <h5>Who am I  & what do I teach?:</h5>Hi nice to meet you.I'm Dwayne; a musician, autism advocate and a New York City computer science teacher currently teaching 9th, 10th, and 11th grade.
            
            In the past year I have taught Snap, P5, JavaScript,Web design, Mongo DB, and Flask and the list is growing.That is the thing about tech; as you do, you learn ! 
            
            <h5>CS ed thoughts:</h5>I look at everyday as a learning experience and have embedded my self in non stop learning ever since I started on this coding journey.Although I like teaching I am still open to new opportunities to develop. My goal is to be a full fledged engineer as well as start my own tech company.I think its great that we are empowering young minds with the knowledge to do the same.
